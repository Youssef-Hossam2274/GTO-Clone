                The business hours for GTO Electronic Marketing are 09:00 to 21:00 Monday to Friday and Sunday. 11:00 am to 20:00 on Saturday. Enquiries received outside of these hours will be responded to promptly on the next working day.
                Our method of communication with you, the customer, is via your GTO WhatsApp group. All quotations and confirmations will be sent to you via this method.
                Bookings will only be made once payment has been made and a screenshot of the transaction sent to us. In addition, we will also need the names and nationalities of all guests/passengers as shown on their passport.
                We aim to send confirmation of the booking within 1 hour of payment being made and names/nationalities being sent to us. During busier periods it may take longer, we will advise you if this is the case.
                A confirmation sent to your GTO WhatsApp group is deemed to be delivered unless we are notified otherwise.
                You must notify us of any errors on booking confirmations immediately so they can be corrected.
                Hotel Confirmation Numbers will be sent to you 48 - 72 hours before check-in.
                Any modification of bookings will be treated as cancellation of the existing booking and making a new booking. Please check your confirmation for the cancellation policy.
