# GTO Clone

This project is a clone of a real-world web application developed for GTO, a tourism company. The purpose of this project is to replicate the user interface and functionality of the GTO website as part of an internship at Bit 68.

## Project Overview

During my internship at Bit 68, I was tasked with cloning the GTO website to gain hands-on experience with modern web development frameworks and libraries. This project involves recreating the main functionalities and design of the GTO website using a variety of front-end technologies.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://copy-39xzs36jq-youssef-hossam2274s-projects.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **Next.js**: To utilize server-side rendering (SSR) and optimize performance.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and ensuring the layout is responsive.
- **TypeScript**: To enhance code quality and maintainability with static typing.
- **Swiper.js**: For implementing smooth and customizable slider.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works on all devices.
- **Interactive Carousels**: Using Swiper.js, the website features interactive image and content sliders.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Leveraging Next.js for improved SEO and faster initial load times.
- **Modular Components**: Built with reusable React components for better scalability and maintainability.
